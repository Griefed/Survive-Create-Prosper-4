All seeds from https://wiki.griefed.de/en/SCP/seeds with pre-made word-settings.json's so you can
use the 'Import Settings'-feature of Minecraft.

For suggestions, open an issue over at: https://github.com/Griefed/Survive-Create-Prosper-4/issues/ as a Documentation Request, include the seed you wish to be added and describe why it should be added. Including screenshots of the spawn area will increase the likelyhood of your seed being added.

**Applied Energistics, Immersive Engineering / Petroleum / Railroading, Extreme Reactors, SecurityCraft and more mods aim to satisfy your technologie needs whilst staying immersive.**

**Botania, Blood Magic, Psi and other mods aim to quell your hunger for magical prowess.**

**A variety of useful, decorative or cool mods like Artifacts, Camera Mod, Cooking for Blockheads, Pam's Harvestcraft, Macaw's mods, Mystical Agriculture and addons, Paintings++, The Undergarden and lots of other mods add to the world, so you will always have something to explore, build, decorate or create.**
